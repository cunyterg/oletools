Howto: Add unittests
--------------------

For helping python's unittest to discover your tests, do the
following:

* create a subdirectory within oletools/tests/
  - The directory name must be a valid python package name,
    so must not include '-', for example
  - e.g. oletools/tests/my_feature

* Create a __init__.py inside that directory
  - can be empty but must be there

* Copy the unittest_template.py into your test directory

* Rename your copy of the template to fit its purpose
  - file name must start with 'test' and end with '.py'
  - e.g. oletools/tests/my_feature/test_bla.py

* Create python code inside that directory
  - classes names must start with Test and must be subclasses
    of Unittest.TestCase
  - test functions inside your test cases must start with test_
  - see unittest_template.py for examples

* If your unit test requires test files, put them into a subdir
  of oletools/tests/test-data with some name that clarifies what
  tests it belongs to
  - e.g. oletools/tests/test-data/my_feature/example.doc
  - Do not add files with actual evil malware macros! Only harmless
    test data!

* Test that unittests work by running from the oletools base dir:
  python -m unittest discover -v

* Re-test with python2 and python3 (if possible)
